  Good Articles to keep in mind:

specifically: "If your framework melts away into an informal collection of modules that happen to work well together but can be easily repurposed by people who don't use the framework, then you have built something very sublime."

  PRE ALPHA:

  
  Things to Add:
    - Wagner for postproccessing
    - Some new Vert / Frag Shaders
    - Physics ( maybe ammo? )

  - Projects: 
    -Meta Balls!

  TODO:

  Loader:
  - loader conditions, which passes in parameters, and only fires
    when all those parameters are accomplished

  Raycaster:
    - Make it so that you are adding to raycaster intersects array,
      rather than looping through ALLL children.

  UserMediaTexture:
    - split into getUserMedia, and videoTexture

  VideoTexture:
    - split into getVideo , and videoTexture
